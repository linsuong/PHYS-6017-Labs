things to do:

know: equation of motion is:
mL^2 d2(theta)/dt^2 + k d(theta)/dt + mgl sin(theta) = FL cos(omega t)

take t = tau (L/g)^(1/2)

things happen when external periodic force frequency, omega is slightly less than natural frequency of the oscillation
f decreases as amplitude increases m- pendulum resonance with forcing frequency omega.
omega = (1 - eta)(g/L)^(1/2), eta == small

convert equation of motion into dimensionless form, obtaining
(k/mL sqrt(gL)), F/mg and eta.

convert 2nd order ode into 2 first order ode, use runge kutta to gain solutions

in the simulation, start from rest (or opposite) and explore what happens as damping increases
where damping is increased.

things to note:
- dont get too much data
- important data only (at the extremes, transition points, etc.)

data to collect:
the transition point - track a parameter, i.e. amplitude s.t. a clear change can be observed

things to think about:
- pendulum animation probably? with a time counter at the bottom to accurately reflect what happens.
        - how to incorporate this into the project? does LaTeX support .gif?

- presentation of data: no tables, use graphs, clear labelling, clear pointing if anything needs to be pointed out

- flow of the report

- INTERPRETATION.
